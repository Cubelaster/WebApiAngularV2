# WebApiAngularV2
First project based on WebAPI + Angular2

This project is based on Angular CLI - https://cli.angular.io/
Setup was done according to instructions from:
https://medium.com/@levifuller/building-an-angular-application-with-asp-net-core-in-visual-studio-2017-visualized-f4b163830eaa


After downloading this repo, you need to set it up for development.
Setup process:
Visual Studio (I used 2017) and npm
1. Clone repo
2. Using npm, install Angular CLI: npm install @angular/cli --global
3. Install packages: Navigate to WebApiAngularV2 folder (the application folder) and from command line run: npm install
   This will install all the dependencies required for the solution to build
4. From same command line, run ng build
   This builds the solution to wwwroot folder and angular app is now ready to serve
